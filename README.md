# Drillthrough-using-Power-BI
We have created a report which gives the sales details according to the city names in page-1. In page-2 we have created a table showing citynames and sales. We added city names  to our drillthrough field. When we go to page-1 and right click on anyone of the city we will get a drillthrough option which takes us to page-2 to show the sales of the respective city.
